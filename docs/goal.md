# What is the goal of Inago?
Inago is a deployment tool that manages groups of unit files to deploy them to
a fleet cluster similar to `fleetctl`. Since `fleetctl` is quite limited, Inago
aims to abstract units away and provide more sugar on top like update
strategies. That way the user can manage unit files more easily.
